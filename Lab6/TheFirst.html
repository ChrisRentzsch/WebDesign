            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <p>When held items were first introduced in Generation 2, there weren't very many to choose from. At the time, there were only 40 items that had some kind of effect in battle. There were various types of berries, which each had different effects, from restoring a small amount of HP, to healing status conditions. Each type had an item that would boost the power of moves of that type. Some Pokemon had items who's effects were exclusive to that Pokemon.</p>

            <p>Today, there are hundreds of held items for people to choose from. Most of the held items introduced back in Generation 2 are mostly obsolete. Some of them are no longer in the games, and some have had their names and/or functions changed since their introduction.</p>
