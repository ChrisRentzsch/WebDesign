            <h2>Increased Power At A Cost</h2>
            <p>The Life Orb was introduced in Generation 4 and its effect is an interesting one. It boosts the power of a Pokemon's moves by 33%, but that power boost comes at a cost. Whenever a Pokemon holding a Life Orb lands and attack, they lose 10% of their max HP. In most cases, this in fine, as a Pokemon holding a Life Orb is usually meant to function as a glass cannon that does as much damage as it can before being knocked out.</p>

            <p>The introduction of the Life Orb didn't have a huge impact on the competitive scene. It just meant that some Pokemon were hitting a lot harder than before. Pokemon with high Attack and Special Attack stats benefited from it because it meant they could stampede through an opponent's team and then the rest of the team could finish off the remaining Pokemon.</p>
