            <p>Sometimes, a Pokemon needs a little extra boost in order to be really good in battle. That's what held items are for. A good held item can change a Pokemon from being just mediocre, to really strong. Their effects range from HP regeneration, to making a Pokemon stronger, to damaging the opponent. Some items can only be used once in battle, such as berries and the Focus Sash. Other items boost the power of a Pokemon's moves, but usually at a cost. In any case, held items are a huge part of competitive Pokemon, and competitive play would be a lot different without them.</p>

            <p>At first there weren't very many held items for people to choose from. But now, there are hundreds of items for players  to choose from to give their Pokemon a little extra edge in battle. Some held items are great, some are only useful in specific situations, and some are completely useless.</p>
