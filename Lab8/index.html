                <p>Terraria is one of my favorite games of all time. However, the game won't be getting any new content added to it. Last year, Terraria had its final update, named Jourey's End. For most games, no more updates means that the playerbase will slowly wander away from the game. However, Terraria's developer, ReLogic, made the decision to leave extra content for the game in the hands of the Terraria community. Through the use of a Terraria mod called TModLoader, players could install mods to the game. TModLoader had already existed for a while before the release of Jourey's End, but it had done so without official support from ReLogic.</p>

                    <h3>Calamity Mod</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The Calamity Mod is one of the most well known Terraria mods. The mod adds over 500 new items to the game, along with several new bosses and an entirely new biome. One of Calamity's biggest features is that it expands on the end of the game. Normally, Terraria is 'beaten' when you defeat the Moon Lord. However, Calamity adds several bosses after the Moon Lord, leading up to a final superboss, Supreme Calamitas.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Mod Of Redemption</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>If there was a mod that could give Calamity a run for its money as my favorite mod, it would be the Mod Of Redemption. The Mod Of Redemption doesn't add nearly as many items and bosses as Calamity, but it makes up for that with a large amount of lore. The Mod Of Redemption's final boss, Nebuleus, Angel of the Cosmos, is one of my favorite boss fights of all time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Fargo's Mutant Mod</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Unlike Calamity and Mod Of Redemption, Fargo's Mutant Mod doesn't add any bosses. It's the NPCs that the mod adds that make it a great mod. Fargo's Mutant Mod adds three NPCs, the Deviant, who sells items to summon mini-bosses, the Abomination, who sells items to start events, and the Mutant, who sells items used to summon bosses. The Abomination and the Mutant are especially useful, because sometimes, boss/event item have relatively expensive crating recipes. The Deviant is useful because in most cases, mini-bosses are hard to find.</p>
