        <h1>My Favorite Pokemon</h1>
        <h2>Typhlosion</h2>
        <h3>Type: Fire</h3>

        <p>Typhlosion is my favorite Pokemon. My first Pokemon game was Pokemon Silver Version and Typhlosion is the final evolution of the game's Fire type starter Pokemon, Cyndaquil. I chose Cyndaquil as my starter because I thought it was the cutest. At the time, I didn't know anything about building a balanced team, so I played through the game using just my starter. One of Typhlosion's strengths is its ability to handle any type of Pokemon. The wide variety of moves that Typhlosion can learn allow it to cover its weaknesses.</p>

        <h2>Toxapex</h2>
        <h3>Type: Water/Poison</h3>

        <p>Toxapex is my favorite Pokemon to use in competitive battles. Its battle style is to poison its opponents and then absorb attacks until the opponent is knocked out. This fits perfectly with my patient playstyle. Toxapex also deals more damage to poisoned opponents. The ability "Merciless" allows Toxapex to always get a critical hit on a poisoned opponent. However, Toxapex's biggest weakness is it's low speed stat, which means that it will rarely move first.</p>
