        <h1>Torterra</h1>
        <h2>Type: Grass/Ground</h2>
        <h3>Nickname: Pangaea</h3>

        <p>Torterra is one of my favorite Grass type Pokemon. It is the final evolution of Turtwig, one of the starter Pokemon from the Sinnoh Region. Torterra is pretty slow, but its built like a tank. It isn't nearly as bulky as Toxapex, but it can take a few hits (unless it gets hit with an Ice type move). Torterra gets access to powerful moves like Seed Bomb and Earthquake, while also being able to regain HP with Leech Seed. Leech Seed doesn't do any damage when it is used, but a Pokemon that gets hit by it loses 1/8 of their maximum HP at the end of each turn. That HP is then given to Torterra, allowing it to chip away at opponents, while also hitting like a truck. The nickname 'Pangaea' comes from Torterra's Pokedex description, where it is listed as the Continent Pokemon.</p>
