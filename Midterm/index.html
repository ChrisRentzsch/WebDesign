            <p>Pokemon is a fantastic game series. However, one of the problems that the games face is the sheer number of Pokemon that exist. As of right now, 896 Pokemon exist. One thing that I think would be interesting is a Pokemon game that functions kind of like a MMO, where you can travel to all the different regions, as well as have every Pokemon available to use. Putting together a team for a game like this would be very difficult due to the sheer number of Pokemon that exist. Out of all 896 Pokemon, you can only have a maximum of 6 at any time. Even if you removed Legendary Pokemon, you would still have 800 Pokemon to choose from.</p>
