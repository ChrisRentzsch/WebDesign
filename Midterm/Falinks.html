            <p>Falinks is one of the newest additions to the world of Pokemon. It was introduced in the newest main series Pokemon games, Pokemon Sword & Shield. Falinks is in the same boat as Goodra, being incredibly cute, while also being very strong. Falinks also has an interesting signature move, No Retreat. No Retreat gives Falinks a boost to all of its stats, at the cost of not being able to switch out and being forced to stay in battle until it is knocked out. Its ability, Battle Armor, prevents Falinks from being hit with a critical hit. The nickname 'Conga' comes from Falinks' design. I know it's supposed to look like they're marching in formation, but I just see a bunch of little ball guys wearing helmets and doing the Conga Line.</p>
