        <h1>My Ideal Pokemon Team</h1>

        <p>Pokemon is a fantastic game series. However, one of the problems that the games face is the sheer number of Pokemon that exist. As of right now, 896 Pokemon exist. One thing that I think would be interesting is a Pokemon game that functions kind of like a MMO, where you can travel to all the different regions, as well as have every Pokemon available to use.</p>
