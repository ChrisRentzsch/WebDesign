            <p>Pokemon X & Y aren't my favorite games in the Pokemon series. However, I really like a lot of the Pokemon from those games. Goodra is my favorite Dragon type Pokemon and also my favorite Pokemon from Generation 6. In some cases, Pokemon sacrifice power for cuteness or cuteness for power. With Goodra, there is a perfect balance of cuteness and power. Goodra is also able to learn a wide variety of moves, so it can cover its weaknesses to Fairy types as well as other Dragon types. The nickname 'Goober' is based solely on Goodra's slimy, sticky design.</p>
