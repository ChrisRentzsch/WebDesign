            <h2>Restoring HP One Turn At A Time</h2>
            <p>The Leftovers item was one of the first held items introduced in Generation 2. It is still a very popular and useful item today, having stood the test of time since its introduction. At the end of each turn, the Leftovers item restores 1/16 of a Pokemon's max HP. For Pokemon with lower HP, this isn't super useful, but for Pokemon with high HP (Ex: Snorlax) the Leftovers drastically increase the amount of time a Pokemon can spend in battle.</p>

            <p>The Black Sludge is an item similar to the Leftovers in that it rest 1/16 of a Pokemon's max HP. However, the Black Sludge only benefits Poison-type Pokemon. If the Pokemon holding the Black Sludge is not a Poison-type, it loses 1/8 of its max HP.</p>
