            <h2>Hanging On By A Thread</h2>
            <p>Ever seen a movie or an anime where a character survives something that definetely should have killed them? That's what the Focus Sash does. The Focus Sash was introduced in Generation 4. Its effect allows the Pokemon holding it to survive an attack with 1 HP, as long as the Pokemon was at full HP before the attack. This allowed Pokemon with high attacking stats, but low defensive stats to take a hit and still do some major damage.</p>

            <p>The Focus Sash is definetely a good item, but it has a pretty big weakness. In order for the Focus Sash's effect to occur, the Pokemon holding it must be at full HP. Field moves that set up hazards like Stealth Rock or Spikes will cause the Focus Sash's benefits to be lost, unless the Pokemon holding it has a way to recover HP.</p>
