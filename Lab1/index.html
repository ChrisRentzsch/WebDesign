        <h1>Competitive Pokemon</h1>
        <p>I first started playing Pokemon competitively around 3 years ago. At the time, I had no idea what I was doing or what Pokemon worked well together. But I kept working on it and discovered that it's kind of like a puzzle. Some Pokemon work well together while others hinder each other. Of course, there are Pokemon that can do enough damage by themselves. My favorite Pokemon to use in competitive matches is Toxapex. Yeah, it's ugly, but with the right moves, it's almost unkillable.</p>
