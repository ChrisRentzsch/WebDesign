        <h2>Why? Why do these exist?</h2>
        <p>Most Pokemon are fine in my book. However, there are a select few that I despise. Sometimes, it's because I think the design is bad or ugly. Other times, it's because I had a negative experience with a Pokemon in the past. For one of them, it's a combination of both reasons.</p>

        <p>I'm just gonna say it. Sunflora is an abomination. I've hated this thing ever since I first saw it. Sunflora is a Grass type that first appeared in Generation 2, which is my favorite generation of Pokemon, and as a kid, I always though that it was creepy. 15 years later, and I still hate that thing. On top of being ugly, Sunflora is also not a very good Pokemon. There are so many other options for Grass types that are better than Sunflora in every way.</p>
